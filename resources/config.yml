# Command used to change groups (Leave default for PurePerms)
Group_Command: "setgroup"

# Every rank added needs a label, alias, and permission:
# Label → The label will be the text you see in the UI
# Alias → The alias is the name of the group in your groups.yml file
# Permission → Permission node required to switch to the rank

# You can use '§' or '&' in the labels for colors and effects to show up on the UI
# For images, use 'url' or 'path' to show an image in the menus (or leave blank to disable)
# Note: If you are using a URL, do NOT include the 'https://' or 'http://' in the link!
# Add as many ranks as you'd like using this format → Label:Alias:Permission:ImageType:Path/URL
